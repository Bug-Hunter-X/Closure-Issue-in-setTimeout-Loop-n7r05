This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript closure issue that occurs when using `setTimeout` within a loop. The problem arises because the `setTimeout` callback function references the variable `i` from its surrounding scope, but by the time the `setTimeout` functions finally execute, the loop has already completed, and `i` will always hold its final value (10 in this case). The solution shows how to use a closure to capture the current value of `i` in each iteration.  This ensures that the correct value of `i` is logged when each `setTimeout` function executes.
